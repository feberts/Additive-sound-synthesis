## Additive sound synthesis

This web application demonstrates the artificial generation of a piano sound using [additive sound synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis) and [envelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)). Implemented with *Vue.js*, *JavaScript* and the *Mozilla Web Audio API*.

The demo application can be run [here](https://feberts.github.io/Additive-sound-synthesis/). It's an interval ear trainer.

The PDF (German) describes the mathematical principles and some aspects of the implementation.
