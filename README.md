## Additive sound synthesis

This web application demonstrates the generation of a piano sound using [additive sound synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis) and [envelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)). Implemented with *Vue.js*, *JavaScript* and the *Mozilla Web Audio API*.

The PDF (German) describes the mathematical principles and certain aspects of the implementation.

You can run the demo application [here](https://feberts.github.io/eartrainer/). It's an interval ear trainer.
